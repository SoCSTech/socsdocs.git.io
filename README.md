# The Techncians' Guide to the Galaxy
## What's this?

This is the hotly anticipated Docs site on how to actually do you job! This
will cover everything from imaging, server operations, software guides, HR advice
and more!

## Cool! How do I contribute?

Easy, clone the repo and open it in your favourite JetBrains editor - they're all free using your UoL account! Cheers JetBrains! 

If you're unsure on which one to pick, [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is not a bad choice. 
You will then need to open your settings and then install the [`Writerside`](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/) extension.

The guide will automatically update and republish when you push - as it has a workflow configured. You're welcome.

Please ensure that anything sensitive, such as IP addresses, keys and Passwords do not
make it onto the Docs. That's what 1Password is for. You can reference where 
you can find that information, just don't include it here as it is publicly
accessible!
