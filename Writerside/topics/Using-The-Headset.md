# Using The Headset
If you're not familiar with using a VR headset, no need to worry as this article will run you through what you need to know.

## Buttons and Adjustments
The power button is on the side of the headset, with the volume buttons at the bottom. The headset charges using USB-C, the port for
which can be found on the left side of the headset.

Place the headset in front of your eyes, and adjust the back and top straps until it's comfortable. If it's still blurry, you can adjust the spacing
between the lenses by taking off the headset and pushing the lenses towards or away from each other inside the headset.

There should be 2 controllers that you'll use to navigate, make sure the one labelled 'L' is in your left hand and 'R' is in your right. The trigger
button at the back will be used to confirm, and you move the cursor by moving the controller around in your hand.

## Setting Up Boundary
When you start up the headset, it will ask you to set up a guardian boundary. This is basically the physical space that you'll be using when in the headset. During this set-up, you should
be able to see your surrounding environment in black and white. This is called being in passthrough mode. 

First, it will ask you to set the floor height. To do this, place the controller with the ring side down onto the floor. This should update on the screen where the floor is. 
If you're in a seated position, for example if you're just downloading some software or checking something, you can choose 'stationary boundary'. 

However, if you're standing and wish to be able to move around while using the headset, you will be better to draw your boundary. 
Use the controller to trace the edge of a safe play area, for example if you're in the VR room you should have a clear floor space in the booth you're in which 
you can trace as your boundary. 

Once you've set your boundary, your surroundings will change from the real world to a fake environment, and you should have a menu in front of you.

If you move and want the menu to be re-centred, hold down the button on the right controller and the menu will be centered in front of where you're currently looking.

When you want to turn off the headset, simply hold down the power button on the right side of the headset until power options come up. You can choose to shut down or reset. 
You may also have the option to update before it shuts down or reset.
