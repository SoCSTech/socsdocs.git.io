# Who Are We?

Well, we're all Technicians, duh!

In all seriousness however, unlike many other Computer Science departments across the sector, we do not use directly
provisioned resources from Central ICT. We have to fend for ourselves in most cases. The best analogy for this is to
imagine that ICT are Network Rail - they provide the infrastructure, and we are LNER, we run the services on top of 
the infrastructure.

This set up means we have strategically placed Technical Services right within the School. We can provide much more
focused and specialised support for our teaching and research. 

We just have to cry back to DT when a projector breaks or the network stops working...
