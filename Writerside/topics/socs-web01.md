# seps-app01

`seps-app01` (formerly known as `socs-web01`) is our main Docker server. It provides hosting for all of our tools (such as snipe-it), digital signage, and also hosts some tools for the Computer Science Society (CSS).

> The server was renamed in 2025 to match in with the new School name after Computer Science, Maths & Physics and Engineering merged in AY 24/25 to create the School of Engineering & Physical Sciences.

The server is configured via the private [SoCSTech/seps-app01](https://github.com/SoCSTech/seps-app01) repo. The repo contains all the information that is needed to get the server back-up and running.

<warning>
All changes must be documented and approved using the Git repo. Any service found running without it being documented inside the Git repo is liable for removal.
