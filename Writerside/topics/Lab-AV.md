# Lab AV

## Overview
Our Lab AV (if it's still the Extron based system) can be incredibly annoying to deal with and is very prone to randomly breaking.

Therefore, it is imperative that we ensure these systems are working correctly - otherwise teaching is severely impacted for that day.

**Due to the fact that we do not manage our AV directly, we are at the mercy of DT (formally known as ICT) to fix it for us.**

## Aims
To ensure that the AV is working correctly in our labs - and identify any issues that will need raising with DT.

## Procedure
* Ensure Lectern PC is turned on
* Ensure the display mode is set to Duplicate
* Use the Extron Panel to turn on the Room AV system
    * The projectors can take up to 90 seconds to start up and "warm up"
* There should now be a display on the walls - if not, check the above steps and connections from the PC to the System. 
    * If you continue to have issues - contact DT on 01522 886500 
* **Repeat steps for all labs!**
