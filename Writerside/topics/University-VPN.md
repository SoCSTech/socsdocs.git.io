# University VPN

You will need this to connect to protected internal resources when you're not connected from a desk or a corporate machine on the managed wifi network.

This will also be referred to as 'Cisco VPN' or 'Cisco Anyconnect' - that is because that's what's used at the time of writing.

[A guide has been created by Digital Services who manage the service, you should follow that](https://digitaltechnologies.lincoln.ac.uk/2022/07/20/how-to-vpn/)

Note, on a non-corporate Windows laptop you will need to install this manually.
