# TOIL

When you work outside your contracted hours, you will earn Time off In Lieu, also known as TOIL.

For example, if you have to stay an hour late at work during a busy period, you will then get an hour of TOIL.
Working an Open Day will give you 7.5 hours of TOIL regardless of the actual hours you were there.

This time off can then be taken on another day, for example to take off the whole day with 7.5 hours, starting an hour late, leaving a few hours early, etc.

This page will show you how to put in the TOIL you worked into MyView, so you can use it to book time off.

First, log into MyView like usual. Then you'll see this box on the homepage. 

Click the drop-down menu where it says 'request', and choose the option 'log new attendance'. 

On the screen that comes up next, they'll be a few options. For our current purpose, click 'accrue time off in lieu'.

On the next screen that comes up, you can select the date that you worked overtime as well as how many hours you worked. 
You can choose to add a comment in the 'comments' box if you want, for example something like "Worked Open Day". 

Press submit and you're done, it will appear on your account once your line manager approves it.
