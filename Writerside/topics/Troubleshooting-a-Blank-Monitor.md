# Troubleshooting a Blank Monitor

If a monitor appears to be blank whilst using a PC, there’s a few steps you can try before coming to us.

1. Make sure the display is turned on, it should either be On, or in Standby, usually showing some kind of indication. If this is not the case, use the power button to attempt to turn it on.

2. If the monitor doesn’t turn on with the power button – this would indicate some other power issue that you’d need to contact us about. Include the PC’s location and Desk Number (you can find this in the bottom left of the desk).

3. If the monitor is on, check the connections either HDMI or DisplayPort, ensure they are correctly connected to both the Monitor and GPU.

4. If connections are good, Windows may not be correctly configured. Pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> will show a "Project" menu, in whereby choosing to `Extend` should bring the second monitor to life.

If the above steps don’t work for you, please contact the technicians!
