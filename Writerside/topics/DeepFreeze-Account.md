# DeepFreeze Account

DeepFreeze has [its own section](DeepFreeze.md), however you need to make sure you have an Admin account for the 
cloud console. The Line Manager should have done this for you, if they haven't - chase them! 

Use [1Password](1Password.md) to make a strong password for your account - there is an awful lot of damage that can 
be done using DeepFreeze, and you don't want your details to fall into the wrong hands.
