# INB2305 - Lab 2C

INB2305 (Lab 2C) is a computing lab primarily used by Maths & Physics. Technically we are responsible for it, but in practise
Sergey (M&P technician) manages the lab, we are just here to help him.

## General Lab Information

### Capacity
2C has a capacity of 77 lab PCs.

### Imaging
This lab is imaged using our master machines and CloneZilla, as detailed in the Lab Imaging section.

We usually ask Sergey what he needs with the lab, and most of the time he just tells us to leave it alone, so we do.

### AV
We don't check the AV in 2C, this is left to M&P staff.

### PC Checks
We don't check the PCs before 9am in 2C, this is left to M&P staff.

## Unique Features

### Lack of Deep Freeze
There is no Deep Freeze in 2C, at the request of M&P.

### Shared Lab
As we share this lab with Maths and Physics, sometimes our modules get put in here. Due to the lab image being completely
different and the PCs being much less powerful, many modules simply won't work in here. If a module is timetabled for 2C,
we need to let the module coordinator know so they can get it re-timetabled for a more suitable room.
