# Room Condition

You will also need to check the state of the wall, if the wall in INB1102/INB1301 needs to be open for 9 am, it needs to be opened before 9 am and the AV system combined.

You should also check that the room has been left in a suitable condition;
- Have people left chairs over the room?
- Are the chairs pushed under desks?
- Are keyboards, mice and hdmi cables plugged into the computer correctly (i.e. not unplugged for someone to use with their laptop)?
- Any general health and safety issues that need to be raised?
