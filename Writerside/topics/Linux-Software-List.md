# Linux Software List

You should recapture this for each semester to ensure that nothing has changed!

We typically like to install (if not installed with the distro) these tools on top of a standard full built distro, currently Pop_OS!;

- Docker (with user access to the `docker` group),
- [Nvidia Container Toolkit](https://lncn.ac/nvct),
- VS Code,
- Firefox[^1]
- Neovim
- LibreOffice (the whole suite!)
- tmux
- git

[^1]: Do not install Google Chrome. Chrome will try and install itself as a snap package etc, and will not respect you wanting to have it always open as incognito! You should do this with Firefox, in the setting you can set it to 'never remember history'
