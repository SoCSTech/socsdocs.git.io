# Wellbeing

Your wellbeing is important, both physical and mental. There are things that the University has in place to help you with any wellbeing issues and concerns that come up.

Remember, you can always talk to your line manager who can help you through all your options. However, an overview of some of the avenues of help will be outlined in the child topics of this page.

Additionally, information about what wellbeing support there is at the university can be found on the HR Wellbeing page, [found here](https://hr.lincoln.ac.uk/wellbeing/).
