# Other Types of Leave

There are other types of leave that are less common, but you may still occasionally have to book them.
This is things like paid leave of absence and voluntary events like graduation. If there is leave you'd like to book and isn't explained in these docs, please speak to your line manager who can advise you further.


## Paid/Unpaid Leave of Absence
For paid or unpaid leaves of absence, the method of booking it is the same as booking holiday, so you can start by follow the instructions found [here](Holiday.md). 


When you're faced with a choice of types of leave, instead of choosing 'Holiday', choose whichever one you would like to book from the options presented. 
From there, you can enter the days of leave, if it's full days or part days, and the total time off. You'll have to click 'confirm planned work time' and save.
Then, select the reason for the absence, for example 'bereavement' or 'jury duty'.
You can then press submit, and after being approved by your line manager it will appear on your account.

## Voluntary Events (E.g. Graduation)

The method for booking off time to attend voluntary events such as graduation is very similar to booking of TOIL. 
Start by following [these instructions](TOIL.md). 

When shown the types of attendance screen, simple choose the one you'd like to book. 
Then choose the day, and the total time you would like to book. 
Add a comment if you'd like, then press submit. 
After your line manager approves it, it will be added to your account.
