# Snipe-IT

Snipe-IT is an open-source asset management solution, and we use it to manage our internal asset list. We use it to keep a track of what things should be where, and we use it to record extra information around an asset.

As a technician you should have access to the system, but academics will not have access.

You will need to be on the [University VPN](University-VPN.md) to access this, and have access to [SEPS-APP01](socs-web01.md) via that, at the time of writing you should just have access.

Once you have access - you will need to have credentials made and at that point you will be given the URL. Save these in [1Password!](1Password.md)
