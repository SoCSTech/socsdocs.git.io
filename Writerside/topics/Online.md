There are a number of courses that are mandatory for all staff to complete. 

## How to access and complete online training
Online mandatory training can be completed at _uol.learning.uk.com/totara/dashboard_.
Upon going to the website, log in with your university email and password if prompted. Once you’ve logged in, you’ll be met with this screen. Choose ‘Mandatory’, and you’ll see a list of online courses. 

You will have to complete all of these- but don’t worry, they don’t take too long!
