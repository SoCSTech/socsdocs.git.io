# Your Staff Laptop

To actually get anything done, you will obviously need a Computer! However, there are a few things to ensure you have set up
on your device. 

The department makes use of Laptops with Ultrawide monitors. This is so we can quickly move locations, work directly 
in Labs, or work on our Riseholme campus.

## Options

We have a few different Laptops you can choose from:

| Laptop            | Basic Spec                                                       |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Asus Zenbook      | 13" Screen, 11th Gen i7, 16GB RAM, 10+ hr battery life           |
| Lenovo Legion     | 15" 144Hz Screen, 9th Gen i7, GTX1660Ti GPU, 16GB RAM            |
| HP ZBook Power G9 | 15" Screen, 12th Gen i7, Nvidia A2000 GPU, 32GB RAM (DT Managed) |
| MacBooks          | Various Spec - M1 (DT Managed), i7 and i9 Configs                |

Take whatever works best for you. MacBooks are currently extremely limited in terms of stock at the time of writing this chapter.

As a Computing Technician, you may find having a Windows Based laptop more useful so you can do local testing, rather than
relying on a VM or Bootcamp - both really only work properly on Intel-based Macs.

## Security Requirements

Encryption on all Staff Devices is **strictly enforced** as of 2023. This is to ensure we meet or exceed security policy
set by DT. This is achieved using either BitLocker for Windows, FileVault for macOS or LUKS for Linux. 
DT managed devices will already be encrypted, and obviously, set up to meet their requirements.

User accounts on non-DT managed devices **must not** be connected to personal accounts - for example, signing in to 
MS services for Windows, or iCloud for macOS. All accounts must be secured with a strong password.
