# Deploying DeepFreeze

Deploying DeepFreeze is as simple as running an installer. The installer can be downloaded from the
main dashboard by clicking the 'Install Cloud Agent' button.

From this page, a group should be selected, which will have an enforced policy. In this case, the 1A
group is selected which has the 'Computing' policy enforced.

This installer can be used in Lab 1A to deploy DeepFreeze. Usually we also create a batch script
which copies the installer from a memory stick to the computer, and then runs the installer. This way,
we don't need to wait for the installer to finish before we unplug the memory stick.
