There is an Extron controller by the lectern which can turn on/off the projector, but there is only one input called 'Laptop'. Despite it saying laptop, it is used to display the lectern PC. An HDMI cable runs from the PC under the desk to the HDMI port in the wall.

When an academic wishes to use a laptop, they should unplug the HDMI cable from the PC.

The projector in 1B can be combined to display the PC/Laptop connected to the controller in 1A, but this can only be
done from the 1A side. More details on this can be found in the 1A documentation.

More details on how to check the lab AV can be found in the Lab AV section.

## PC Checks
All of the PCs in this room also need checking before 9am, especially if there is an exam that day. You must turn them
all on, either manually or via Deep Freeze, and ensure that they all boot and display the lock screen.

## Unique Features

### Wall to INB1102
The wall between 1A and 1B can be opened/closed using the key kept in INB1201. This allows the labs to be combined into
one big lab. We do this frequently for exams and modules with a large number of students.

Generally, we only close the wall when there is a session run specifically in INB1301.

### Wall Vinyl

The room has vinyl on the walls which was installed in 2024 in partnership with XMA and ASUS ROG. 

If the wall has become scuffed, you should clean the walls ASAP with a damp cloth and clean water. This is because the vinyl is the same as what can be installed on floors and is designed to be hard wearing but isn't bulletproof.

If the vinyl gets damaged or needs repairing - there is some offcuts in the store room, but there isn't enough to redo a whole panel.
