# Attendance Monitoring

Due to how the attendance monitoring system works, students are unable to register their attendance from the lab machines, and must instead use a mobile device (i.e. smartphone, tablet or laptop) connected to the `eduroam` wifi network. 

Please see the information from [Digital Technologies on how to connect](https://lncn.ac/uniwifi).
