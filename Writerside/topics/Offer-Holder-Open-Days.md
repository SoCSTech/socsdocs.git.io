# Offer Holder/Open Days
One of the main uses for the phones is for an activity on Offer Holder Days and Open Days.
The exact activity being run will be told to you by an academic close to the date of the day you're working. 
However, all phone activities require the same set-up from the end of the technicians and this page will explain that process to you.

Firstly, before the day make sure that all the phones are fully charged, and that there is no previous work on them.
Look at the [setting up documentation](Setting-Up.md) for more details on this. 

Once they're all set up and ready to go, take them out and to the room the activity will be in on the morning of the day (normally INB1102 but check before the event).

Put one phone on every other computer, as the students will work in pairs. You will either need to do this on 2 or 4 rows in the centre of the room 
(closest to the lectern) depending on how many students are expected on the day.

Get the phones out their boxes, turn them on and plug them into the PC. Leave the box on top of the PC tower so it's easy to put them back after the activity is done.

Let the academic run the activity, and when it's over put away the phones back into their boxes. 

You will then need to reset the ones which have been used and set them up again ready for their next use. The details on how to do this can be found [here](Setting-Up.md).

And that's all you need to know about how the phones are used on Offer Holder Days and Open Days!
