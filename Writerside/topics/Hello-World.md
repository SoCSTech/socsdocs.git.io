# Hello World

Hello! This is a handy little guide with the intention of sharing knowledge from old Computing Technicians to new ones!

Use the sidebar to flick through topics in which you may need some help! Or you can upload the generated [llms.txt file](https://docs.socstech.support/llms.txt) to ask questions with [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.cloud.microsoft) or other LLM.

It should be expected that some of the information provided within this documentation here will be out of date by the time that you are reading this - but we will try to keep this as up to date as we can!

You should also make a note in that the School name changed after Computer Science, Maths & Physics and Engineering merged in AY 24/25 to create the School of Engineering & Physical Sciences.

- **SEPS** - School of Engineering and Physical Sciences
- **EPS** - (School of) Engineering and Physical Sciences
- **SoCS** - School of Computer Science -> SEPS
- **SoE** - School of Engineering -> SEPS
- **SoMP** - School of Maths and Physics -> SEPS

Other departments in that we work with use the following initialism in the wild such as:

- **DT** - Digital Technologies
- **DS** - Digital Services 
- **ICT** - Migrated into DT or DS (depending on the context)
- **PPC** - People, Performance and Culture (aka HR)
- **HR** - Human Resources, (legacy see PPC)
