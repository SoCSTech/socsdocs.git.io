# 1Password

We use 1Password to manage all our Passwords in the department. It offers a fantastic solution to securely share 
passwords between all Technicians, and comes with the added bonus of giving you a free account to use at home.

## Installation

Download [1Password here](https://1password.com/downloads), and install it. If you already set up your browser, 1Password
will automatically install its extension and sign in for you. 

## Account Setup

The Line Manager will have set up your account as part of onboarding. You will also have recieved a link to set up
a personal account for home use! Again, we heavily recommend you take full advantage of this, 1Password is a fantastic
password manager.

Use the details given to you to sign in to 1Password.

## Vault Setup

Now that you're logged in, you will see 2 vaults for your work account, Personal and Shared. Use Personal for individual logins
and Shared for anything we have shared access to, for example, Steam. You can import any saved logins from other Password
Managers if needed. 

It is well worth your time setting up 2FA using 1Password, as it will manage all OTPs, and will autofill these for you 
in the browser!

We also recommend you set up your SSH keys using 1Password. It can act as the SSH Service/Daemon and manage your keys for you,
as well as Authentication for these keys. SSH keys are used for Server access and Git.
