# Mental Health 

There are multiple avenues to get help if you're struggling with your mental health for any reason, which we'll explore in on this page. Details of all wellbeing options can be found on the HR Wellbeing hub website ([HR Wellbeing Information](https://hr.lincoln.ac.uk/wellbeing/)).

You can also speak to your line manager, a colleague, or whoever you feel comfortable with.
Don’t hesitate to use what’s available to you and reach out if you need to.

## Mental Health First-Aiders  

[Mental Health First Aider Information](https://hr.lincoln.ac.uk/wellbeing/mental-wellbeing/mental-health-first-aiders/)

The university has a programme where people take on the role of mental health first-aiders, and act as friendly faces who are available for any member of staff to contact for help and support with their mental health. 

The university HR website describes the University of Lincoln Mental Health First Aiders to be _'a point of contact and support for any member of staff experiencing a mental ill health issue or emotional distress, in exactly the same way as you would contact a First Aider if you were to have an accident or injury at work.'_

However, it's worth noting that they are not mental health professionals so can't provide therapy, counselling, or any diagnosis. They're more there to be a kind and supporting presence, listen to your problems, and help signpost you to suitable professional help and ongoing support.
