# In-Person
Some of the mandatory training you'll have to complete will be conducted face to face. This page will go through how to book onto this training. This is the same process you'll use when booking non-mandatory training, like Fire Marshall training or personal development courses. We'll go over optional training more in the next section.
## How to book your in-person training

Training courses can be booked through MyView. To do this, first go to _hr.lincoln.ac.uk/hrselfservice/_. Once you’re on the site, you’ll see this screen. Click where it says ‘Click here to log in to MyView’.

To the left of the screen, there will be a list of sites- click on ‘My Training and Development’. Once you click on it, a drop-down menu will open with more options. To book onto your mandatory training, select 
‘New Course Booking’.
