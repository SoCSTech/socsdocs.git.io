## Capacity
2C has a capacity of 77 lab PCs.

## Imaging
This lab is imaged using our master machines and CloneZilla, as detailed in the Lab Imaging section.

## AV
The AV in 2C needs to be checked before 9am every day.

There is an Extron controller by the lectern which can turn on/off the projector. This is one of the newer touch screen
controllers and generally works with no issues.

More details on how to check the lab AV can be found in the Lab AV section.

## PC Checks
All the PCs in this room also need checking before 9am, especially if there is an exam that day. You must turn them
all on, either manually or via Deep Freeze, and ensure that they all boot and display the lock screen.
