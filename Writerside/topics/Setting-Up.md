# Setting Up
After every offer holder day or open day, the phones that have been used will need resetting. 
You can tell which ones need resetting as they will have an app on them called something like 'Cloud Vision App' or 'Offer Holder Day App'. 
Basically, any custom Android app that wasn't there before means it's been used as needs to be reset.

The reason we reset the phones after use is so that the students can make the app themselves.
If the old app someone else made was still there, it would spoil what the end result would be and may mess up some of the instructions of the activity. 

## Factory Reset
After the phones get used for an Offer Holder Day or Open Day, we should reset them to remove the software created at the event,
and to make sure any information the visitors may have entered into the phone are also cleared.

In order to do this, we first go to settings in the phone, then go to system. Choose advanced, then under advanced choose reset options.
Choose 'erase all data (factory reset)' and then confirm by selecting 'reset phone'.

Once you have selected this, the phone will turn off and reset, showing you a progress bar. When it is done, it will turn back on and greet you with a very loud tune, so you know it's done.

## Setting Up Phone After Reset
After the phone resets, there are a few things we need to do. It will take you through the set-up, you can just press next for all of this. When it asks you to connect to Wi-Fi,
press skip for now. There is a fix we'll have to do with the Wi-Fi for it to work.

### Fix Wi-Fi
We want to connect to the UoL Visitor Wi-Fi, but in order to do so there's a little fix we need to do.

First, open up settings, then network settings. Select 'UoL Visitor Wi-Fi' from the available networks. This will take you to an external login page.
Close this, we do not need to log in. Go back to the Wi-Fi page, and press the cogs next to the Visitor Wi-Fi network.
In the network settings, go to where it says 'randomise device mac address'. Press this, and instead choose 'use device mac address'.

The device mac address of the phone is authorised for Visitor Wi-Fi, so once the correct mac address is being used, the networks recognises the device, and you should now be connected to the Wi-Fi.
If there are issues with this, and you're not connected after doing this change, contact DT to get the MAC address authorised.

### Put Phone Into Developer Mode
Once the set-up is done, we need to turn on developer mode and USB debugging so that the Offer Holder Day/Open Day activities can be run on the phone.

Before we can enable USB debugging, we first need to turn on developer mode. To do this, we first go to settings, then system.
We then go to 'About phone'. Once in the 'about phone' menu, find the build number and tap it until the prompt at the bottom of the screen says 'you are now a developer!'.

Now we're a developer, we can turn on USB debugging. To do this, we first go to settings and then system. Once in system, we choose advanced to open up the drop-down list of extra options.
Once of these options which will now be available is developer options.
Scroll down until you find USB debugging, and switch it on. It will prompt you to confirm that you want to allow it, choose 'ok'.

### Update AR Services
The only other thing you need to do before you're done is to update AR services on the phone.

First, open up the store. Then in the corner of the screen, press the 3 dots and in the pop-up menu, select 'updates'.
There will be a long list of updates, but the only one you need to make sure is updated is 'Google Play Services for AR'. Scroll down until you find it, press update, and then wait until it's finished.
Do not worry about doing the rest of the updates, they are not needed.

And you're done! Just make sure the phones are charged up, and with the plug and wire in the box, then it's good to get put away.
