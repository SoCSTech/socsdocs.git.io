# Other Training
There is additional training you can complete, which you can discuss with your line manager. This includes first aid, fire marshalling, working at heights, and manual handling. Which of these courses, if any, you'll complete can be discussed with your line manager.

If it's decided that you will complete any of these courses, this page details how you book yourself onto each one.

## Manual Handling
This training will likely be mandatory for a technician, but still check with your line manager just in case. To book onto this training, email safety@lincoln.ac.uk. 

For more details about manual handing, and to see upcoming training dates, check the Health and Safety website [here](https://universityoflincoln.sharepoint.com/sites/HS/ManualHandling/Pages/Default.aspx).

## Step-Ladder/Working at Heights

It may be beneficial for your job to have training working at heights, or using a ladder. Discuss with your line manager to see if the training would be beneficial.

If you do need to book the training, email safety@lincoln.ac.uk. 
They'll let you know upcoming dates for training, and you can reply to them to book onto whichever one suits you best.

## Fire Marshall 
Fire marshals are responsible for helping in the event of a fire, making sure there is a successful evacuation. It's an optional role, though it is good if there's at least 1 fire marshall for each floor. 

For more details on the role, and upcoming training dates, check the Health and Safety page [here](https://universityoflincoln.sharepoint.com/sites/HS/FireSafety/Pages/Default.aspx). To book onto one of the training dates, email safety@lincoln.ac.uk.

## First Aid
Being a first-aider is a big responsibility, but it's also an important role to fill. It's entirely optional, but if you're interested discuss with your line manager in the first instance.

If your line manager agrees that first aid training would be a good fit for you, your next step will be to email safety@lincoln.ac.uk and ask if there are any vacancies for first-aiders and if so, if you can book onto training.

There will be a form you will need to fill in and sign, and get your line manager to sign. The people from Health and Safety will walk you through the process in more detail.

For more information about First Aid, and to see a list of First Aiders, check the Health and Safety site [here](https://universityoflincoln.sharepoint.com/sites/HS/FirstAid/Pages/Default.aspx).
