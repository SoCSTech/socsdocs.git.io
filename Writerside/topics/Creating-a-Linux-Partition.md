# Creating a Linux Partition

To create the Linux Partition, simply follow the same steps as installing Windows 11, but with the Pop_OS! ISO instead. When installing Pop_OS! it will prompt you to choose
how much partition space to allocate to Pop_OS! and set up dual boot.

We usually allocate about 250GB to Linux, but this may vary depending on the requirements for Linux per academic year.
