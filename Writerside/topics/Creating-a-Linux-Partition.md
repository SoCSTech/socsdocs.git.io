# Creating a Linux Partition

To create the Linux Partition, simply follow the same steps as installing Windows 11, but with the Ubuntu ISO instead. When installing Ubuntu it will prompt you to choose
how much partition space to allocate to Ubuntu and set up dual boot.

We usually allocate about 250GB to Linux, but this may vary depending on the requirements for Linux per academic year.
