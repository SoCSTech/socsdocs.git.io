# Phones

We have a number of phones that are used in modules and student projects, as well as Open Days. 
There are currently 30 Motorola G10 Power phones that we use.

his page will go over how to prep and maintain the phones so that they're always good to go for the next person who needs them.

## Factory Reset After Use
After the phones get used for an Offer Holder Day or Open Day, we should reset them to remove the software created at the event, 
and to make sure any information the visitors may have entered into the phone are also cleared. 

In order to do this, we first go to settings in the phone, then go to system. Choose advanced, then under advanced choose reset options.
Choose 'erase all data (factory reset)' and then confirm by selecting 'reset phone'.

Once you have selected this, the phone will turn off and reset, showing you a progress bar. When it is done, it will turn back on and greet you with a very loud tune, so you know it's done.

## Setting Up Phone After Reset
After the phone resets, there are a few things we need to do. It will take you through the set-up, where all you really need to do is connect to Wi-Fi
and proceed through the rest of it. 

Once the set-up is done, we need to turn on developer mode and USB debugging so that the Offer Holder Day/Open Day activities can be run on the phone.

Before we can enable USB debugging, we first need to turn on developer mode. To do this, we first go to settings, then system.
We then go to 'About phone'. Once in the 'about phone' menu, find the build number and tap it until the prompt at the bottom of the screen says 'you are now a developer!'.

Now we're a developer, we can turn on USB debugging. To do this, we first go to settings and then system. Once in system, we choose advanced to open up the drop-down list of extra options.
Once of these options which will now be available is developer options. 
Scroll down until you find USB debugging, and switch it on. It will prompt you to confirm that you want to allow it, choose 'ok'.

And you're done! Just make sure the phones are charged up, and with the plug and wire in the box, then it's good to get put away.
