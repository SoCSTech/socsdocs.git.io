## Clearing Boundary History
To prevent issues with the headset becoming overloaded with too many saved boundaries and causing issues such as being stuck in passthrough mode, 
we should clear the boundary history at least once every few months, for example when we get the headsets out to charge them.

Doing this is easy. First, we go into the settings menu. Then, click 'guardian', which will open up the settings relating to the guardian boundaries.
Find the 'clear boundary history' option and press 'clear'. Confirm you wish to do this on the confirmation window that will appear, and you'll be done. 
Once you do this, your current boundary will also be cleared so it's best to do this as the last thing you do before turning the headset off.

## If Headset Gets Stuck in Passthrough
Although clearing the boundary history often should prevent the issue where the headset gets stuck in passthrough mode, if it does
happen it's important to know what to do about it.

For most issues with the headset, including this one, you can fix it by factory resetting the headset.
To do this, first make sure the headset is powered off.
Then, you must press and hold the power and volume down buttons together until the boot screen loads.

On this screen, you'll be able to use the volume buttons to navigate up and down on the menu and the power button to select.
Navigate down to the option 'Factory reset', and press the power button to confirm. It will then start the resetting process,
and once it's done it should no longer be stuck in passthrough mode.

The newly-reset headset will now need to be set up again, the details of how to do so can be found here.
