# Viewing Your Leave

MyView has a handy calendar view where you can see all your leave. This page will walk you through how to access it, and what it all means when you're looking at it.

## Accessing the Calendar

Firstly, log onto MyView using the method found [here](MyView.md).

Once you're on the dashboard, look to the navigation bar on the left hand side of the screen.

A few items down, there will be an option for 'My Leave and Claims'. Click this, and it will open up a drop-down menu. 
From the options that will appear, select 'Leave Calendar View'.

You will then be met with the calendar, the best way to view your leave. 

## Viewing the Calendar

This section will run you through how to read the calendar, and what functionality it has. 

As standard, when no leave has been booked for a certain week, it will look like this.

However, when leave has been booked, the spaces for the days will be filled with letters denoting the type of leave. **NOTE: This text will be green when it's submitted but not yet approved by your line manager. Then, it will turn black when fully approved.**

First is 'HOL', for holiday/annual leave (for details of this type of leave, see [here](Holiday.md)).
