# Hephaestus

Hephaestus is a Kubernetes HPC Cluster currently being developed by the School, with assistance of George O. 

Based on Talos Linux, the way we manage this Cluster is very different to dealing with other Servers - and therefore it 
has its own  documentation on the Organisation site in Github. However, some basics will be outlined here to make you 
aware of the scope of the system, and some basic operations guides.
