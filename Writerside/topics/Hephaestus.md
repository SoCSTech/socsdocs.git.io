# Hephaestus

Hephaestus was a Kubernetes HPC Cluster currently being developed by the School, with assistance of George O. 

This has now been superseded by DT, if anyone requires more compute than what can be provided in a standard machine, this should be referred to DT.

Based on Talos Linux, the way we manage this Cluster was very different to dealing with other Servers - and therefore it 
has its own  documentation on the Organisation site in Github. However, some basics will be outlined here to make you 
aware of the scope of the system, and some basic operations guides.
