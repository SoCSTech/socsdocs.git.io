# Lab Rules

Rules and expected behaviour across all SEPS Labs:

- These facilities are provided by the **School of Engineering & Physical Sciences**. Access is only given to **Computer Science** students, and should not be given to anyone else.

- Unless prearranged with SEPS Technicians, **machines should only be used for educational purposes** — gaming is prohibited.
 
- **Disruptive behaviour will not be tolerated**, quiet working should always be maintained.
 
- If audio is required, **you must wear headphones**.
 
- **Absolutely no food or drink** is to be consumed in the labs, this also applies to food and drinks with lids.
 
- **Respect your environment** – labs should be left tidy ready for the next set of students to use. Please tuck in your chair when you leave the desk.
 
- Staff and/or demonstrators may ask you to leave if you are not part of a timetabled event. **If asked, please leave in an orderly fashion**.
 
- Between **18:00 and 08:00** ensure you are aware of and adhere to lone working policy [(lncn.ac/lwp)](https://lncn.ac/lwp), and sign the Lone Working Register in INB Lobby (next to the double automatic doors).
 
- Check the digital signage next to the door to the labs before you enter. **If the lab is in maintenance, do not enter.**
